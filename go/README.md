# Go
After watching rwxrob streams, I figure out that go might be intereting
to learn and play with. It seems powerfull tool to do testing and
scripting.



## Agenda
https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module
- ~~Create a module -- Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.~~
- ~~Call your code from another module -- Import and use your new module.~~
- ~~Return and handle an error -- Add simple error handling.~~
- Return a random greeting -- Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays).
- Return greetings for multiple people -- Store key/value pairs in a map.
- Add a test -- Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code.
- Compile and install the application -- Compile and install your code locally.
